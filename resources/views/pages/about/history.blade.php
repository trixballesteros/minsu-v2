                        The Mindoro State University (MinSU), formerly the Mindoro State College of Agriculture and
                        Technology (MinSCAT) was originally the Mindoro National Agricultural School (MINAS) created by
                        virtue of R.A. 506 sponsored by then Oriental Mindoro Congressman Raul T. Leuterio. It formally
                        opened its door for learning on August 26, 1951 with the 26 pioneering students.

                        In 1963, by virtue of R.A. 3758, the Collegiate Department was opened. This steered the offering
                        of several collegiate courses. The first two (2) years leading to the degree of Bachelor of
                        Science in Agriculture (BSA) was initially offered. This was followed by the two-year course
                        leading to Associate in Agricultural Technology (AAT) in 1973; then the complete course
                        offerings of Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Education (BSAE) in 1975; and Bachelor of
                        Science in Agriculture (BSA) in 1977. In 1980 the new BSA curriculum was adopted which was
                        developed by the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education based at UP Los Baños.

                        The expanded collegiate course offerings made MINAS a full-fledged College, named Mindoro
                        College of Agriculture and Technology (MCAT) on July 10, 1976. The trend continued when MCAT was
                        converted into Mindoro State College of Agriculture and Technology (MinSCAT) under R.A. 8007 on
                        May 25, 1995 through House Bill No. 2354 entitled “An Act Converting MCAT into a State College”
                        which was filed by then Congressman Renato V. Leviste and was endorsed to the Senate under
                        Senate Bill 1674 sponsored by Senator Raul S. Roco. On December 7, 1994 Senate Committee on
                        Education, Culture and Arts chaired by Senator Leticia R. Shahani submitted the proposal to
                        President Fidel V. Ramos for approval, declaring MinSCAT as the first and only state college in
                        Oriental Mindoro.
                    </p>
                    <p>February 7, 2001 marked another milestone in the history of MinSU with the integration of the two
                        (2) CHED supervised institutions in the province, namely: the Bongabong College of Fisheries now
                        MinSU-Bongabong Campus and the Polytechnic College of Calapan now MinSU-Calapan City Campus.</p>
                    <p>The MinSU-Bongabong Campus originally the Bongabong School of Fisheries (BSF) was established on
                        September 21, 1964 by virtue of Republic Act No. 3306. In 1975, the government approved the
                        offering of the Revised Fishery Technical Education Curriculum. It was converted into a
                        full-fledged college, Bongabong College of Fisheries (BCF) on July 5, 1995 by virtue of R. A. 8143.
                    </p>
                    <p>The MinSU-Calapan City Campus, on the other hand, was established as a government secondary trade
                        school known as Calapan School of Arts and Trades (CSAT) by virtue of R.A. 3397 in June 1961. In
                        1972, CSAT merited the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) approval to offer Trade
                        Technical Education Curriculum. Efforts to convert the institution into a College authorized to
                        offer degree courses were realized with the approval of R.A. 8076 in June 19, 1995 converting
                        CSAT to Polytechnic College of Calapan (PCC). With the integration, the PCC evolved into
                        MinSCAT, now MinSU – Calapan City Campus. The MinSU, with three campuses within the two
                        congressional districts in Oriental Mindoro was recognized as the only public institution of
                        higher learning in the Province of Oriental Mindoro.</p>
                    <p>In pursuit of innovative and transformative education and quality services to the clientele,
                        MinSCAT envisioned to become a University. By virtue of RA 10596 as amended by RA 11006, the
                        Mindoro State College of Agriculture and Technology (MinSCAT) was converted into Mindoro State
                        University on June 4, 2013 with provisions for compliance before the grant as full-fledged
                        university through House Bill No. 4448 entitled with Congress authors/co-author Franklin M.
                        Drilon and Rodolfo G. Valencia, respectively and sponsor Edgardo J. Angara respectively. RA
                        11006 which amended RA 10596 was sponsored by Paulino Salvador C. Leachon.</p>
                    <p>On March 16, 2021, the long-sought dream to become a full-fledged university was realized after
                        the certification by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) of full compliance to the
                        operational requirements and validated by the Office of Institutional Quality Assurance and
                        Governance (OIQAG) by virtue of the Resolution No. 110-2021 by the Commission en banc dated
                        March 16, 2021 and Resolution No. 01, series of 2021 of the Mindoro State University Board of
                        Regents. The Mindoro State University (MinSU) is the first ever University in the province of
                        Oriental Mindoro and the youngest in the MIMAROPA Region. </p>
                    <p>The leadership of MinSU has progressed from its first superintendent, Mr. Eligio C. Ureta
                        (1951-1962); Mr. Onofre F. Martin (1962-1963); Mr. Crispin E. Cabanilla (1963-1965); Mr. Antonio

                        (1990-1991); Mr. Jeremias A. Ortiz as Administrator-OIC (1991-1994); and Dr. Angelito A. Bacudo
                        as Principal-OIC (1994-1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>On July 8, 1996, Dr. Angelito A. Bacudo was installed as the first President of MinSCAT until his
                        untimely demise in February 2007. Dr. Levy B. Arago, Jr., the Vice President for Academic
                        Affairs during the time was designated as the Officer-In-Charge to the Office of the President
                        from February 2007 to June 2007. Dr. Bacudo’s untimely demise called for the search for new
                        College President which favored Dr. Jesse T. Zamora who was appointed by the Board of Trustees
                        on August 2, 2007 as the second President of MinSCAT. Dr. Zamora took his leadership until July

                    <p>On July 10, 2018, Dr. Levy B. Arago, Jr. was appointed by the Board of Trustees as the third and
                        last President of MinSCAT which term ended on August 26, 2021.</p>
                    <p>On August 27, 2021, the historical inauguration of the University was held vis-à-vis the oath
                        taking with the CHED Chairperson Professor Prospero E. De Vera III and investiture ceremonies of
                        the First University President DR. LEVY B. ARAGO, JR. which appointment
                        commenced from August 27, 2021 to August 27, 2025.</p>
                    <p> Following the mandatory retirement of Dr. Arago, Jr. on November 05, 2023, the MinSU Governing Board
                        designated Dr. Christian Anthony C. Agutaya, its concurrent Vice President for Research, Development
                        and Extension, as the Officer-In-Charge to the Office of the University President. To this date, Dr. Agutaya
                        remains to be the OIC-President while the University pursues its search for a new president.
